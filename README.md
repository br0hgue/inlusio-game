An indie adventure game developed by two high school studends.

The game is based on [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/) documentation along with many Brackeys tutorials.

This game won't be open-source, so there is no point in writing this other than to pretend i'm doing something.
